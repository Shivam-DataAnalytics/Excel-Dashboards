# 📊 Excel Dashboards Collection

Welcome to my Excel Dashboards repository! This is a growing collection of interactive dashboards designed using Microsoft Excel. Each dashboard visualizes real-world data and provides insights using charts, slicers, conditional formatting, and other Excel features.

## 📁 Repository Structure

I will be uploading dashboards **one by one** as I complete them. Each dashboard will be placed in its own folder with a clear name and may include:

- The Excel file (.xlsx)
- A brief overview or notes in a `README.md`
- Sample screenshots or related visuals
